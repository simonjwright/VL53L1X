This is an Ada-language driver for the STMicroelectronics [VL53L1X](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html) ranging sensor.

It's based on STMicroelectronics's STSW-IMG009 C-language driver, and initially includes that driver via an automatically-generated binding. It's intended to reduce the dependence on C in stages.
